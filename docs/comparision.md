Like broken down in which type of project you would be using you want to make sure you chose which one is more effective. Choosing between MySQL on a VM and a Managed MySQL service simply comes down to how much work you want to handle yourself versus letting the cloud take care of it.
When working a s**mall student app** a Managed MySQL service is the easiest and most reliable option. It automatically handles updates, backups, which removes nearly all the operational work. A VM would only add extra maintenance for a very small workload.
For a **department analytics database**, a Managed MySQL service is still the better fit. Analytics workloads often grow or change, and the managed option makes scaling, high availability, and monitoring straightforward. Running on a VM would require the department to manage capacity, failover, and tuning themselves, which usually isn’t worth the effort unless they need very specific custom configurations.
For a **HIPAA-aligned workload**, a Managed MySQL service is usually the best choice—as long as the cloud provider offers a BAA. Managed services include built-in encryption, logging, patching, and secure defaults that simplify HIPAA compliance. A VM can also meet HIPAA requirements, but it demands more work to secure, monitor, and maintain continuously.
